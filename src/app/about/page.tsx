				<h2>Coding Experience</h2>
				<p>
					TypeScript and Python are the langauges I excell with, having used
					them both commercially and personally to build performant and scalable
					full-stack web applications, with tools like React, Node.js and Flask.
					During my 2.5 years at Qudo, I gained exposure to DevOps tools such as
					Docker, Ansible, and Git CI/CD pipelines.

					As Lead AI developer at GeniusLead, I led a small team of junior team
					members to build bespoke voice applications for Alexa and Google Hub
					devices. I was also responisble for my building my own projects,
					deploying them to AWS Lambda, the Alexa Store and Google Cloud
					Platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have also completed a number of online courses, including an
					Advanced Python course, an Intermediate Machine Learning course and a
					Python for Data Science course. I enjoy coding in my free time and
					have completed a number of projects in various languages. Take a look
